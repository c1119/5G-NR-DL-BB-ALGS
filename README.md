# 5G-NR-DL-BB-ALGS
Here I record some results of my 5G NR
downlink baseband algorithm research in
the SPARE TIME. So the simulation is not
extensive for limited energy, time and
computing resource. I choose to keep the
details of algorithms to myself. Any
comments on the performance are welcome to
c11191119@126.com, especially those
pointing out where the performance is
poor.
