# 5G-NR-DL-BB-ALGS
Here I record some results of my 5G NR
downlink baseband algorithm research in
the SPARE TIME. So the simulation is not
extensive for limited energy, time and
computing resource. I choose to keep the
details of algorithms to myself. Any
comments on the performance are welcome to
c11191119@126.com, especially those
pointing out where the performance is
poor.

11. it is realized that the circular buffer was improperly limited in the PDSCH throughput simulation. don't want to rerun all the simulation. just let it be the performance for that parameter value. 2024-8-29
12. Today I decide to record some NR PBCH demodulation data as a goodbye to the busy and sick 2024, and hope to have a fruitful and healthy 2025, 2025-1-3
13. Study Doppler spread estimation in the NR PBCH demodulation case, 2025-2-15
14. Some progress in advanced receiver exploration is achieved, 2025-2-22
